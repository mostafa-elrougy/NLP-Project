To run the code you need to upload the dataset and the fonts used to your drive and mount your drive then give the path of each of them to the cell that requires them.

while running the code, after preprocessing the data, when you run the cells that contain the arabert word embeddings you need to run all the cells that uses it's output as input to the machine learning models(SVM, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, KNN) before running the cells that perform the tfidf feature extraction or vice versa.
